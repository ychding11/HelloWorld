#List of source code
The source code is a collection of algorithm demo. including array,list stack binary search tree, graph and so on. 
##Introduce
sort.cpp: the source code of memory sort algorithms including bubble sort, quick sort, simple insert sort and bit sort.


`enum {
SORT_TYPE_SIMPLE_INSERT,
SORT_TYPE_BUBBLE,
SORT_TYPE_QUICK_SORT,
SORT_TYPE_BIT_SORT,
SORT_TYPE_COUNT,
};`

##Use Specification
the test data is generated by rand() function call in libc. 
usage: sort [sort type]  [test number]
***
##Introduce
random.cpp: the source code of demo generate random integer number algorithms. It can generate the following type random integer numbers.
##Use Specification
the generated random data is outputed to stdout. it is easy to redirect the output to file.the random app can generate three types random number.

+ ordinary random number containing duplicates and unsorted.  usage: random
+ distinct random number without duplicates but unsorted.   usage: random [count]. count is the number of random number, count is also the range of random number.
+ distinct and sorted random numbers.  usage: random [range]  [count]. range is the range of random number, count is the number of random number.
***
##Introduce
txtextractor.cpp: the source code of demo counting the world and its frequency. It read txt from stdin then count the world and its frequency in txt.
##Use Specification
to count the word and its frequncy info by the demo, you need do it in this way.
cat txt | txtextractor
***
##Introduce
isduplicate.cpp: read data from stdin and check whether input sequence contains duplicates or not.

isasending.cpp: read data from stdin and check whether input sequence is asending or not.

isdesending.cpp:read data from stdin and check whether input sequence is desending or not.
##Use Specification
the example usage is like this: random | isduplicate. to check the generated random sequence contains duplicates or not.
***
##Introduce
maxLenRepeatedStr.cpp: read data from stdin, build the string suffix array, caculate the max len of repeated string, just repeate one.

##Use Specification
the example usage is like this: cat txt | maxLenRepeatedStr.
